## Bug 1: Method Not Allowed Error in app.py
### Description
Users encountered a "Method Not Allowed" error upon form submission, indicating a restriction in request methods.
### Cause
The Flask route in app.py was limited to handling only POST requests, causing errors with GET requests.
### Fix
Expanded the Flask route in app.py to handle both GET and POST requests, ensuring smooth form submissions.
### Summary
By allowing both GET and POST requests and ensuring correct data retrieval, the "Method Not Allowed" error has been resolved, improving user interaction.

## Bug 2: Missing Form Submission Method in home.html
### Description
The absence of the method attribute in home.html's form hindered proper form submission.
### Cause
home.html did not specify the method for form submission, resulting in potential errors.
### Fix
Added the method attribute to the form element, setting it to "post" to facilitate proper form submissions.
### Summary
By rectifying the missing method attribute, potential submission errors have been mitigated, enhancing user experience.

## Bug 3: Handling Empty or Non-inputs in Form Field
### Description
Users could submit empty forms, resulting in the addition of empty notes to the list.
### Fix
Implemented validation in app.py to handle empty or non-inputs, appending "None" as a placeholder.
### Summary
A new feature was introduced in app.py to ensure the notes list always contains meaningful data, providing clear feedback to users when no input is provided.

## Summary
The bug fixing process for the Note Taking Application has been successfully completed, resulting in enhanced reliability and user experience. By addressing identified issues in both the backend and frontend, the application now operates seamlessly, meeting industrial standards for robustness and usability.
